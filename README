===[ Conceptual Overview ]===
For onboard sensors (ones connected directly to the Pi)
Sensor Interface --{ JSON }--> Connector --> Database

For remote sensors (connected via another uController)
Microcontroller:
[ (start of Sensor Interface) Sensor Interface --> Connector --> Transmitter
Pi:
Receiver (end of Sensor Interface) ] --{ JSON }--> Connector --> Database


===[ Example setup ]===
Outdoor Unit (remote sensors):
* Oil Level
* Barometer
* Outside Temperature
* Battery Voltage

Indoor Unit:
* Intake Humidity (and Heat Intensity)
* Outflow Humidity (and Heat Intensity)
* Intake Temperature
* Outflow Temperature

* Fan Speed (and Fan Power)

* Electrical Power Consumption
* 20x Temperatur Sensors
